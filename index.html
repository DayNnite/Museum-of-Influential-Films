      <h2>Welcome to the Museum of Influential Films</h2>
      <p>Founded by <strong>Sam Getahun</strong>, this museum was created as a digital tribute to the films that shaped how stories are told on screen. From the earliest experiments in motion to modern global milestones, each collection captures how cinema reflects — and sometimes reshapes — human imagination.</p>

    <!-- History & Concept -->
    <section class="panel">
      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>The museum began as a small archival project in 2025. While researching film history for a university project, Sam noticed how many innovations in modern media trace back to pivotal films — movies that weren’t just hits, but turning points in culture and technology.</p>
      <p>What started as a simple list of “important films” grew into a study of their ripple effects — how <em>Metropolis</em> shaped science fiction, how <em>Do the Right Thing</em> sparked social conversation, and how <em>Parasite</em> redefined what global cinema could mean.</p>

      <h3>About the Museum</h3>
      <p>The Museum of Influential Films doesn’t claim to rank or rate movies — it preserves the stories behind them. Each exhibit focuses on how a film pushed boundaries, inspired creators, or documented cultural shifts in its time.</p>
      <p>We aim to show how creativity connects generations: the same curiosity that drove early filmmakers still fuels today’s digital storytellers.</p>
